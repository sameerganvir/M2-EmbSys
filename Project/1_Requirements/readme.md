# **Description**
- As the non renewable energy resources are decreasing, use of renewable resources for producing electricity is increasing. Solar panels are becoming more popular day by day. Solar panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery.This energy can be utilized when required or can be used as a direct alternative to the grid supply. Utilization of the energy stored in batteries is mentioned in below given applications.
The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent. This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun. So, solar panel should continuously rotate in the direction of Sun. This describes about circuit that rotates solar panel.


# **4Ws 1H**
- Who
  - This is very useful for farmers.
- When 
  - When there is a ample amount of sunlight.
- Where
  - All the Places where Sunlight is mostly available.
- Why
  - To generate high amount of power.
- How
  - Based on the light falling on the two LDRs, the Microcontroller changes the position of the Servo Motor which in turn moves in the panel.


# **SWOT Analysis**
- Strength:
  - More light will be absorbed by solar panel and more amount of power is generated. 
- Opportunities:
  - Growing innovations in solar technology.
- Weakness:
  - Large dependency on sunny weather.
- Threats:
  - Cumbersome maintenance and repair.


# **Requirements**
- High level requirements
  - Solar panel shall rotate according the sunlight detected by the LDRs.
  - It should be sustainable.
  
- Low level requirements
  - LDRs shall detect light.

# **Components Required**
- Solar panel
- Arduino Uno
- Light Dependent Resistor
- Servo Motor
- Resistor
